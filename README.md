A light weight hands on Databricks SQL Workshop
Modern organizations require agile decision-making
with real-time data analytics. Innovation hinges on
predictive insights generated from machine
learning and AI.

Traditional cloud data warehouses have
become legacy systems. They are expensive to
operate, with limited access that slows the speed
of modern organizations. T eams find it
difficult to meet business needs and SLAs,
leading to delayed insights, management
complexity and reduced productivity. In this
situation, organizations often struggle to extract
value from their data warehouse due to high
costs, lack of optimization, and technical debt.

Dozens of government agencies have already
migrated their traditional ETL and data
warehouse workloads, adopting a cloud-based
lakehouse architecture. Join Databricks to
learn more about why a lakehouse is your
